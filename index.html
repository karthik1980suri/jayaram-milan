          Hello there! Our special guest will be <span style="color:rgb(137, 72, 153)">Jayaram Venkatesan, co-founder of Arappor Iyakkam </span> (Tamil for “Non-Violent Movement for Justice”). Jayaram‘s interest in social justice and livelihood generation was deepened when he began volunteering for AID-US in 2002. 
      </p>
      <p>
          He moved back to India in 2007 to work full time on social justice issues.
      </p>
      <p>
          Jayaram founded Arappor Iyakkam in 2015 to build a society where citizens are informed and empowered to ensure government officials are attending to the needs of and are accountable to ordinary citizens.   
      </p>
      <p>
          <span style="color:rgb(137, 72, 153)">In the few years of its existence, Arappor has grown to engage thousands of volunteers </span>to expose some of the most corrupt political officials of the Tamil Nadu government using creative campaigns and mobilization efforts.
      </p>
      <p><span style="color:rgb(137, 72, 153)">The movement has also thrown light on environmental issues such as water body (lakes, ponds etc) maintenance, water works contract work etc</span>. Citizens are now more aware then ever before about the importance of water and water bodies due to Arappor Iyakkam's efforts.</p>
      <p>
          Today, this is one of the foremost movements against corruption in India.   Jayaram will share Arappor volunteers’ persistent efforts to be changemakers pushing for transparent governance.
